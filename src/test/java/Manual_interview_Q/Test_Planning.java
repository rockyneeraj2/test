        What is Test Planning? What is the difference between Test Planning and Test Strategy?

        Excellent 👍 This is a **very common QA interview question**, especially for 3+ years experience.

Let’s break it clearly and professionally.

# ✅ What is Test Planning?

**Test Planning** is the phase in STLC where the QA team defines:

* What to test
* How to test
* When to test
* Who will test
* Tools to use
* Risks involved

It results in a **Test Plan document**.

---

## 🔷 What is Included in Test Planning?

Typical contents of a Test Plan:

* Scope of testing (In-scope / Out-of-scope)
* Testing types (Functional, Regression, API, etc.)
* Resource planning
* Roles & responsibilities
* Test environment details
* Tools to be used
* Schedule & milestones
* Risk analysis & mitigation
* Entry & Exit criteria

---

## 🔷 Example (Real-Time)

For a Banking Application:

* Test Types → Functional + API + Regression
* Tools → Selenium, RestAssured
* Timeline → 4 weeks
* Risks → Delayed build delivery

# ✅ What is Test Strategy?

**Test Strategy** is a high-level document that defines:

* Overall testing approach
* Testing standards
* Testing levels
* Tools & frameworks
* Risk management approach

It is usually:

* Prepared by Test Manager / QA Lead
* Organization-level or project-level
* More stable (rarely changes)

---

# 🔷 What Does Test Strategy Include?

* Testing objectives
* Testing approach (Manual / Automation)
* Test levels (Unit, Integration, System, UAT)
* Tools & technologies
* Test environment strategy
* Risk handling approach
* Compliance standards

# ✅ Difference Between Test Planning and Test Strategy

| Test Planning                | Test Strategy                    |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Detailed document            | High-level document              |
| Project-specific             | Organization or program-level    |
| Changes frequently           | Rarely changes                   |
| Prepared by Test Lead        | Prepared by QA Manager           |
| Defines schedule & resources | Defines overall testing approach |

---

# 🔥 Simple Explanation (Easy Way to Remember)

👉 **Test Strategy = WHAT & HOW at high level**
👉 **Test Plan = WHEN, WHO & HOW in detail**

---

# 🔥 Interview-Ready Answer (2-Min Version)

You can say:

> Test Planning is the process of defining scope, objectives, resources, schedule, and risks for a specific project. It results in a Test Plan document.
>
> Test Strategy is a high-level document that defines the overall testing approach, tools, standards, and methodologies. Strategy is usually organization-level and remains stable, whereas Test Plan is project-specific and may change based on project needs.

---

# 🔥 Advanced-Level Add-On (5+ Years)

You can mention:

* In Agile, Test Strategy may be part of Test Plan
* Automation strategy included inside Test Strategy
* Risk-based testing approach defined in Strategy
* CI/CD & DevOps integration part of Strategy
