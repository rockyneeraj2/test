        Excellent 👍 This is a very common **Agile / Scrum interview question** (especially 3+ years QA roles).

Let’s break it clearly.

# ✅ What is Test Grooming?

**Test Grooming** (also called *Backlog Grooming / Refinement*) is a session where:

* Product Owner
* Developers
* QA
* Scrum Master

review and refine upcoming user stories before the sprint.

---

## 🔷 Purpose of Test Grooming

* Clarify requirements
* Identify missing acceptance criteria
* Estimate story points
* Identify test scenarios
* Raise dependencies & risks
* Discuss automation feasibility

---

## 🔷 QA Role in Test Grooming

As QA, you:

* Ask edge-case questions
* Identify negative scenarios
* Clarify business rules
* Define acceptance criteria
* Estimate testing effort
* Identify test data needs

---

## 🔥 Example (Banking App)

User Story:

> As a user, I want to transfer money.

QA during grooming may ask:

* What is max transfer limit?
* What happens if balance is insufficient?
* Is OTP mandatory?
* What about failed transactions?

This avoids defects later.
