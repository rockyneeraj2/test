# 🔥 50 Rapid-Fire Manual Testing Questions & Answers

---

### 🔹 Basics (1–10)

**1. What is software testing?**
Software testing is the process of verifying and validating that the application meets business requirements and works correctly.

**2. What is SDLC?**
Software Development Life Cycle — the process of developing software from requirements to maintenance.

**3. What is STLC?**
Software Testing Life Cycle — the process of testing phases from requirement analysis to test closure.

**4. Difference between SDLC and STLC?**
SDLC is development process; STLC is testing process.

**5. What is a test case?**
A document containing steps, input data, and expected results to verify functionality.

**6. What is a test scenario?**
A high-level functionality to be tested.

**7. What is a defect?**
A defect is a deviation from expected behavior.

**8. What is defect life cycle?**
The stages a defect goes through from New → Closed.

**9. What is verification?**
Checking documents and design without executing code.

**10. What is validation?**
Testing the actual product by executing it.

### 🔹 Defect Concepts (11–20)

**11. What is severity?**
Impact of the defect on application functionality.

**12. What is priority?**
Urgency to fix the defect.

**13. Difference between severity and priority?**
Severity = impact; Priority = urgency.

**14. What is regression testing?**
Re-testing existing functionality after changes.

**15. What is smoke testing?**
Basic testing to ensure build is stable.

**16. What is sanity testing?**
Focused testing after minor changes.

**17. What is retesting?**
Testing a defect again after it is fixed.

**18. What is exploratory testing?**
Testing without predefined test cases.

**19. What is ad-hoc testing?**
Random testing without formal documentation.

**20. What is acceptance testing?**
Testing done by end users to approve the system.

### 🔹 Types of Testing (21–30)

**21. What is functional testing?**
Testing application features against requirements.

**22. What is non-functional testing?**
Testing performance, usability, security, etc.

**23. What is performance testing?**
Testing system speed and stability under load.

**24. What is load testing?**
Testing system behavior under expected user load.

**25. What is stress testing?**
Testing system beyond its capacity.

**26. What is usability testing?**
Testing user-friendliness of the application.

**27. What is compatibility testing?**
Testing application across browsers/devices/OS.

**28. What is system testing?**
Testing complete system end-to-end.

**29. What is integration testing?**
Testing interaction between modules.

**30. What is UAT?**
User Acceptance Testing done by business users.

---

### 🔹 Test Design Techniques (31–35)

**31. What is Boundary Value Analysis?**
Testing values at boundary limits.

**32. What is Equivalence Partitioning?**
Dividing input data into valid and invalid groups.

**33. What is decision table testing?**
Testing combinations of conditions and actions.

**34. What is state transition testing?**
Testing system behavior for state changes.

**35. What is error guessing?**
Finding defects based on tester experience.

---

### 🔹 Documentation & Process (36–40)

**36. What is RTM?**
Requirement Traceability Matrix ensures requirement coverage.

**37. What is a test plan?**
Document describing testing scope, strategy, and schedule.

**38. What is a test strategy?**
High-level document defining testing approach.

**39. What is test summary report?**
Report summarizing testing activities and results.

**40. What are entry criteria?**
Conditions required before testing starts.

---

### 🔹 Scenario-Based (41–50)

**41. How do you test a login page?**
Test valid/invalid credentials, empty fields, security, session handling.

**42. How do you test a search box?**
Test valid input, invalid input, special characters, empty search.

**43. How do you test a dropdown?**
Verify options, selection, default value, sorting.

**44. How do you test file upload?**
Test valid file types, invalid types, size limit.

**45. What if build is unstable?**
Perform smoke testing and report to developers.

**46. What if requirement is unclear?**
Clarify with BA/PO before writing test cases.

**47. What if developer rejects defect?**
Reproduce with evidence and discuss professionally.

**48. How to prioritize testing with limited time?**
Focus on high-risk and critical modules first.

**49. How to handle production bugs?**
Reproduce issue, analyze logs, validate fix, add regression test.

**50. When do you stop testing?**
When exit criteria are met or acceptable risk is achieved.
