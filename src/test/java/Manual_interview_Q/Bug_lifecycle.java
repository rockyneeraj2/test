# ✅ Bug Life Cycle Stages (Detailed)

---

## 🔷 1️⃣ New

* QA finds a defect
* Logs it in tool (JIRA, Azure DevOps, etc.)
* Status = **New**

Includes:

* Steps to reproduce
* Screenshots
* Logs
* Severity & Priority
* Environment details

---

## 🔷 2️⃣ Assigned

* Bug assigned to developer
* Developer starts analysis

---

## 🔷 3️⃣ Open

* Developer reviews and confirms issue
* Accepts it as valid defect

---

## 🔷 4️⃣ Fixed / Resolved

* Developer fixes the bug
* Code deployed to QA environment
* Status = **Fixed** or **Resolved**

---

## 🔷 5️⃣ Retest

* QA retests the defect
* Verifies fix

---

## 🔷 6️⃣ Closed

* If issue is fixed properly
* QA marks status as **Closed**

---

# 🔴 Alternate Statuses (Important for Interviews)

Sometimes defect does not move to Closed.

---

## 🔹 Reopened

* If issue still exists after fix
* QA reopens defect

---

## 🔹 Rejected

* Developer says:

  * Not a bug
  * Working as expected
  * Duplicate issue

---

## 🔹 Deferred

* Fix postponed to future release
* Low priority

---

## 🔹 Duplicate

* Already reported defect exists

---

## 🔹 Cannot Reproduce

* Developer unable to reproduce issue

---

# 🔥 Real Example

Scenario:

* Login button not working

Flow:
New → Assigned → Open → Fixed → Retest → Closed

If still failing:
New → Assigned → Fixed → Retest → Reopened

---

# 🔥 Important Interview Concepts

### 🔷 Severity vs Priority

| Severity         | Priority          |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Impact on system | Urgency to fix    |
| Set by QA        | Set by PM/Manager |

Example:

* Typo on homepage → Low Severity, High Priority
* Crash in backend log file → High Severity, Low Priority

---

# 🔥 Tools Used for Bug Tracking

* JIRA
* Azure DevOps
* Bugzilla
* HP ALM

---

# 🔥 Interview-Ready Answer (2-Min Version)

You can say:

> Bug Life Cycle defines the stages a defect goes through from identification to closure.
It starts with New, then Assigned, Open, Fixed, Retest, and Closed. There are alternative
 statuses like Reopened, Rejected, Deferred, and Duplicate. This lifecycle ensures proper tracking,
  accountability, and quality control in the software development process.
