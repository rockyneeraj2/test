        Got it 👍 — here is a **SHORT but SENIOR-LEVEL** explanation of **STLC**, exactly how interviewers expect it in **2–3 minutes**.

You can **speak this confidently** in an interview.

# 🧪 STLC – Software Testing Life Cycle

## **Short, Clear & Practical Interview Answer**

**STLC is a structured process that defines how testing activities are planned, executed, and closed to ensure software quality. It runs in parallel with SDLC and starts from requirement analysis itself.**

---

## 1️⃣ Requirement Analysis

**Understanding:**
Analyze requirements from a testing perspective to ensure clarity and testability.

**Practical:**

* Review requirements and domain rules
* Identify test types and risks
* Raise early clarifications

👉 *Example:* Identify missing validation rules in lab workflows.

---

## 2️⃣ Test Planning

**Understanding:**
Define the testing strategy and approach.

**Practical:**

* Decide scope, tools, and timelines
* Choose automation vs manual
* Apply risk-based testing

👉 *Example:* Automate critical lab result flows due to compliance risk.

---

## 3️⃣ Test Case Design

**Understanding:**
Design test scenarios and cases.

**Practical:**

* Write positive, negative, edge cases
* Use BVA, EP, decision tables
* Prepare automation scripts early

👉 *Example:* Decision table for result validation.

---

## 4️⃣ Test Environment Setup

**Understanding:**
Prepare a stable test environment.

**Practical:**

* Validate environment readiness
* Prepare test data
* Configure integrations

👉 *Example:* Create lab samples and instrument simulators.

---

## 5️⃣ Test Execution

**Understanding:**
Execute tests and validate system behavior.

**Practical:**

* Execute manual and automated tests
* Validate UI, API, and DB
* Log defects with evidence

👉 *Example:* Verify end-to-end sample lifecycle.

---

## 6️⃣ Defect Reporting & RCA

**Understanding:**
Track and analyze defects.

**Practical:**

* Log defects clearly
* Perform root cause analysis
* Retest and regress

👉 *Example:* Identify API–UI mapping issue.

---

## 7️⃣ Test Closure

**Understanding:**
Formally conclude testing.

**Practical:**

* Test summary report
* Metrics and lessons learned
* Release sign-off

👉 *Example:* Analyze defect leakage and automation coverage.

---

## 🔥 One-Line Senior Summary (Very Important)

> **“I follow STLC as a continuous, risk-based process integrated with SDLC, focusing on early defect detection, automation, data accuracy, and compliance readiness.”**
