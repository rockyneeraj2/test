    1️⃣ why you resigning from your current job?
    “After my last project was completed, I was temporarily on the bench.
    During that time, I realized I wanted to move into a role with more consistent hands-on
    automation work and long-term growth. My current organization couldn’t immediately align
    me with that direction, so I decided to look for an opportunity where my skills can be utilized continuously.”

    If HR directly asks: “Why did you resign while on bench?”
    “The bench period gave me time to reflect on my career goals.
    I’m someone who prefers being actively involved in challenging work, and since suitable
    projects were not available in the near term, I decided to proactively look for a role
    that better matches my automation experience.”

    If they ask: “Were you asked to resign?”
    “No, it was my decision. I wanted to take control of my career direction rather than wait indefinitely.”

    “I was on bench after project completion and chose to move on to
     find a role with continuous, challenging work aligned to my automation expertise.”

     2️⃣ Why are you looking for a change?
    “I’m looking for opportunities that offer consistent hands-on work and long-term growth.
     I want to be in an environment where I can take ownership of automation strategy and add value continuously.”

     How do you handle pressure or tight deadlines?
    “I prioritize critical test scenarios, automate high-risk areas first,and communicate clearly with stakeholders.
     This helps me stay focused and deliver quality even under tight timelines.”

     Where do you see yourself in 3–5 years?
     “I see myself in a senior or lead automation role, contributing to framework architecture,
      mentoring teams, and improving automation efficiency at scale.”
