        API - Application Programming Interface
        It is a set of rules that allows different software entities to communicate with each other.
        Types of API:
        1. REST API - Representational State Transfer
        2. SOAP API - Simple Object Access Protocol
        3. GraphQL API

        REST API:
        - It is an architectural style for designing networked applications.
        - It uses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
        - It is stateless, meaning each request from client to server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.
        - It typically uses JSON or XML for data exchange.
        - It is widely used for web services and mobile applications due to its simplicity and scalability.

        SOAP API:
        - It is a protocol for exchanging structured information in web services.
        - It relies on XML as its message format.
        - It uses a standardized set of rules for message structure, encoding, and conventions.
        - It is more rigid and has built-in error handling.


        GraphQL API:
        - It is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries.
        - It allows clients to request only the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under

        fetching of data.
        - It uses a single endpoint for all requests, unlike REST which uses multiple endpoints.
        - It provides a more flexible and efficient way to interact with APIs, especially for complex data structures.

        CLientServer Architecture
        Client-Server architecture is a distributed application structure that divides tasks between service providers
         (servers) and service requesters (clients).
         Clients initiate communication by sending requests to servers, which process these requests
